This repo contains an early stage full-stack rust SPA web app nominally constructed as a language learning web site.  It is very much just a personal project at the moment, with the following (ordered) goals:

1. To improve my Rust development skills
1. To improve my knowledge of Web Assembly
1. To improve my Farsi skills
1. To explore new, simpler, safer ways of building a web app by bypassing the overhead/complexity of existing frameworks such as React, and the various weaknesses of JavaScript/TypeScript
1. To explore potential localisation options for multi-language sites, and various text orientations
1. To improve/maintain my Swedish skills
1. To actually build a functioning/pretty website for people to learn languages from

An additional noteworthy note is that I generally dislike external dependencies, and, in my personal projects, enjoy building things ground-up so it is highly likely that I will end up coding a lot of stuff here that would probably just be another npm/cargo package in another situation.
